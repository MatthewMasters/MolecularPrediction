# Molecular Prediction
Predicting molecular properties using message passing neural networks (MPNN). This repository contains some of my code from my work on the [Kaggle "Predicting Molecular Properties" Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/champs-scalar-coupling) in 2019. My code features two implementations of MPNN models (PyTorch and Tensorflow (Deepchem)).

MPNNs are a recent class of neural networks suitable for graph data and has been used to perform learning of molecular structure. A basic introduction to MPNNs can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cWIeTMklzNg).
